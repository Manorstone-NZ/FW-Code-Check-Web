echo "=== Dashboard Chart Visibility Fix ==="
echo ""

echo "🔍 ISSUE ANALYSIS:"
echo "   The dashboard data was actually CORRECT:"
echo "   - Summary: 0 Critical + 1 High + 5 Medium + 0 Low = 6 total"
echo "   - Chart: Shows 6 items on 23 Jun"
echo "   - Numbers match perfectly!"
echo ""

echo "🐛 REAL PROBLEM:"
echo "   The chart bars were too thin to be visible because:"
echo "   - With only 6 total items across all days"
echo "   - The bar width calculation made them nearly invisible"
echo "   - Users couldn't see the colored severity breakdown"
echo ""

echo "✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "   Enhanced chart visibility by:"
echo "   1. Ensuring bars are always at least 15% width when data exists"
echo "   2. Changed condition from 'chartWidth > 0' to 'dayTotal > 0'"
echo "   3. Added minimum width: Math.max(chartWidth, 15)%"
echo ""

DASHBOARD_FILE="src/renderer/pages/EnhancedDashboard.tsx"

echo "📊 VERIFICATION:"
if grep -q "Math.max(chartWidth, 15)" "$DASHBOARD_FILE"; then
    echo "   ✅ Minimum bar width (15%) implemented"
else
    echo "   ❌ Minimum bar width not found"
fi

if grep -q "dayTotal > 0" "$DASHBOARD_FILE"; then
    echo "   ✅ Proper condition for showing bars"
else
    echo "   ❌ Bar display condition not updated"
fi

echo ""
echo "🎯 EXPECTED RESULT:"
echo "   The chart should now show:"
echo "   ✅ Visible bars for days with data (at least 15% width)"
echo "   ✅ Proper color coding: Orange for High, Yellow for Medium"
echo "   ✅ Clear visual representation of the 1 High + 5 Medium items"
echo "   ✅ The bars will be clearly visible instead of hair-thin lines"
echo ""
echo "💡 KEY INSIGHT:"
echo "   The data was always correct - it was just a visualization issue!"
echo "   The summary and chart now both show the same correct data."
