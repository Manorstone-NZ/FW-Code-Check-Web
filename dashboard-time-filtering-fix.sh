echo "üîß HOW THE FIX WORKS:"
echo "   BEFORE:"
echo "   - Metrics: Counted ALL analyses across all time"
echo "   - Daily Chart: Only counted analyses within selected time range"
echo "   - Result: Data mismatch between summary and chart"
echo ""
echo "   AFTER:"
echo "   - Metrics: Count only analyses within selected time range"
echo "   - Daily Chart: Count only analyses within selected time range"
echo "   - Result: Both use the same filtered data set"
echo ""
echo "üéØ EXPECTED RESULT:"
echo "   The summary statistics should now match the daily chart totals"
echo "   When you select '7 days', both metrics and chart show last 7 days data"
echo "   When you select '24h', both show last 24 hours data"
echo "   When you select '30d', both show last 30 days data"
