echo ""

echo "üêõ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:"
echo "   The 'Items per Day by Severity' chart was showing incorrect data"
echo "   Chart showed: 6 Low severity items"  
echo "   Reality showed: 5 Medium + 1 High severity items"
echo ""

echo "üîç ROOT CAUSE:"
echo "   The daily chart calculation was defaulting ALL items with undefined"
echo "   or invalid severity to 'low' severity using this logic:"
echo "   severity = item.severity || item.risk_level || 'low'"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "   1. Removed the default 'low' fallback"
echo "   2. Added proper validation for severity values"
echo "   3. Separated vulnerability and instruction counting"
echo "   4. Only count items with valid severity levels"
echo ""

echo "üîß CODE CHANGES:"
echo "   Before: [...vulns, ...instructions].forEach((item) => {"
echo "           const severity = (item.severity || item.risk_level || 'low')"
echo ""
echo "   After:  vulns.forEach((vuln) => {"
echo "           const severity = vuln.severity?.toLowerCase();"
echo "           if (severity && ['critical','high','medium','low'].includes(severity)) {"
echo ""
echo "           instructions.forEach((instruction) => {"
echo "           const riskLevel = instruction.risk_level?.toLowerCase();"
echo "           if (riskLevel && ['critical','high','medium','low'].includes(riskLevel)) {"

fi

echo ""
echo "üéØ EXPECTED RESULT:"
echo "   The chart should now show the CORRECT severity breakdown:"
echo "   - Only items with valid severity levels are counted"
echo "   - Items without severity are ignored (not counted as 'low')"
echo "   - Chart totals will match the metric card totals"
echo "   - Data alignment between chart and summary is restored"
