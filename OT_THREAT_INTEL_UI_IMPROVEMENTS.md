- Enhanced Summary section with dedicated markdown container
- Better Details section formatting with improved padding (`p-3` instead of `p-2`)
- Added proper spacing between sections (`mb-4` for major sections)
- Response Notes now supports markdown rendering for better formatting

### 4. Enhanced Interactive Elements
- Improved form input styling with better padding (`px-2 py-1`)
- Larger textarea for Response Notes (3 rows instead of 2)
- Added smooth transitions to buttons (`transition-colors`)
- Better button sizing (`px-3 py-2` instead of `px-2 py-1`)

### 5. Better Layout Structure
