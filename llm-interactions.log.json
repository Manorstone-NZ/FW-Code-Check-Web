    "result": "## Detailed Comparison of PLC Code Files\n\nThis analysis compares the provided **Analysis File** with the **Baseline File**. The focus is on identifying differences in logic, structure, security, and potential risks. Key changes, including new, missing, or modified instructions, are highlighted.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n#### General Information\n- **Analysis File**:\n  - **Timestamp**: 05/20/2025 03:35:00 PM\n  - **Block Version**: 2\n  - **Code Length**: 1902\n  - **Logic Length**: 1762\n  - **Data Length**: 32\n\n- **Baseline File**:\n  - **Timestamp**: 06/05/2025 04:31:28 PM\n  - **Block Version**: Not specified\n  - **Code, Logic, Data Lengths**: Not specified\n\n#### Structural Changes\n- **Network 2**:\n  - **Analysis File**: Includes a conditional skip for the ALARM function block using an attacker-controlled bit `M1.0`.\n  - **Baseline File**: This logic is not present, indicating a potential logic bomb or backdoor for bypassing alarms.\n\n- **Network 3**:\n  - **Analysis File**: Contains forced alarm acknowledge and reset using `DB99.DBX 0.1` and `DB99.DBX 0.2`.\n  - **Baseline File**: This logic is absent, suggesting unauthorized manipulation of alarm states.\n\n- **Network 5**:\n  - **Analysis File**: Continuously triggers alarms by calling `FB 103` with specific message evidence.\n  - **Baseline File**: This continuous triggering logic is not present, indicating a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack vector.\n\n- **Network 6**:\n  - **Analysis File**: Bypasses `SWITCH_MAPPING` function when simulation is enabled (`M10.0`).\n  - **Baseline File**: This bypass logic is not present, which could lead to unauthorized simulation mode activation.\n\n#### New or Modified Instructions\n- **Attacker-Controlled Bit**: The use of `M1.0` to skip alarm functions is a significant security risk.\n- **Forced Alarm Acknowledge/Reset**: The direct setting of alarm acknowledge and reset bits (`DB99.DBX 0.1` and `DB99.DBX 0.2`) can lead to unauthorized alarm state changes.\n- **Continuous Alarm Triggering**: The repeated call to `FB 103` with specific message evidence is suspicious and could be used to flood the system with false alarms.\n\n### Security Risks\n- **Logic Bombs**: The conditional logic to skip alarms and force alarm states suggests the presence of logic bombs.\n- **Backdoors**: The use of specific memory bits (`M1.0`, `M10.0`) for critical operations without proper validation indicates potential backdoors.\n- **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**: Continuous alarm triggering can overwhelm the system, leading to a DoS condition.\n\n### Recommendations\n- **Code Review**: Conduct a thorough review of the PLC code to identify and remove unauthorized logic.\n- **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls to prevent unauthorized modifications to PLC programs.\n- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up monitoring for critical memory bits and alarm functions to detect and respond to suspicious activities.\n- **Incident Response**: Prepare an incident response plan to address potential security breaches in the PLC environment.\n\n### Summary\nThe analysis reveals significant deviations from the baseline, indicating potential security threats such as logic bombs, backdoors, and DoS vulnerabilities. Immediate action is recommended to review and secure the PLC environment to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation.",

    "result": "## Comparison of PLC Code Files\n\n### Overview\nThis analysis compares two PLC code files for Organization Block 35 (OB35) in a Siemens PCS7/S7 environment. The analysis focuses on identifying differences in logic, structure, security, and potential risks between the **Analysis File** and the **Baseline File**.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n#### Logic and Structure\n- **Network 2: Alarm Function Block**\n  - **Analysis File**: Includes a conditional skip for the ALARM function block using an attacker-controlled bit (`M1.0`).\n    - **Risk**: This allows an attacker to bypass alarm notifications, potentially hiding critical system alerts.\n  - **Baseline File**: No such conditional skip is present, indicating that alarms are always processed.\n\n- **Network 3: Alarm Acknowledge and Reset**\n  - **Analysis File**: Contains logic to forcefully set the alarm acknowledge (`DB99.DBX 0.1`) and reset (`DB99.DBX 0.2`) push buttons.\n    - **Risk**: This can lead to unauthorized acknowledgment and resetting of alarms, potentially masking ongoing issues.\n  - **Baseline File**: Does not include forced setting of these push buttons.\n\n- **Network 5: Continuous Alarm Triggering**\n  - **Analysis File**: Calls the ALARM function block repeatedly, potentially leading to continuous alarm triggering.\n    - **Risk**: This could be used to flood the system with alarms, causing operator distraction or desensitization.\n  - **Baseline File**: Does not include this repetitive call, suggesting normal alarm operation.\n\n- **Network 6: Switch Mapping Bypass**\n  - **Analysis File**: Includes logic to bypass the `SWITCH_MAPPING` function when simulation is enabled (`M10.0`).\n    - **Risk**: This bypass could be exploited during simulation mode to alter switch input mappings without detection.\n  - **Baseline File**: No bypass logic is present, indicating standard operation.\n\n#### Security and Potential Risks\n- **Attacker-Controlled Bits**: The use of `M1.0` to skip alarm processing is a significant security risk, as it provides a direct method for an attacker to manipulate alarm handling.\n- **Forced Alarm Acknowledgment**: Automatically setting acknowledgment and reset bits can lead to unauthorized control over alarm states, undermining the integrity of the alarm system.\n- **Continuous Alarm Triggering**: Repeated calls to the alarm function can overwhelm operators and potentially mask real alarms, increasing the risk of overlooking critical events.\n- **Simulation Mode Bypass**: The ability to bypass input mappings during simulation can be exploited to test or deploy unauthorized changes without detection.\n\n### Summary of Key Risks and Recommendations\n\n**Key Risks:**\n- **Alarm Bypass and Manipulation**: The ability to skip and forcefully acknowledge alarms poses a critical risk to system integrity and safety.\n- **Potential for Alarm Flooding**: Continuous triggering of alarms can lead to operator overload and desensitization.\n- **Simulation Mode Exploitation**: Bypassing input mappings during simulation can facilitate unauthorized changes.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- **Remove Attacker-Controlled Logic**: Eliminate the use of `M1.0` to control alarm processing and ensure all alarms are processed as intended.\n- **Restrict Alarm Acknowledgment**: Implement checks to prevent unauthorized setting of acknowledgment and reset bits.\n- **Review Alarm Handling Logic**: Ensure that alarm functions are called appropriately and not in a manner that could lead to flooding.\n- **Secure Simulation Mode**: Implement safeguards to prevent unauthorized bypass of input mappings during simulation.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the security and reliability of the PLC system can be significantly enhanced, reducing the risk of cyber-physical attacks and operational disruptions.",

    "result": "## Detailed Comparison of PLC Code Files\n\n### Overview\nThis analysis compares two PLC code files: the **Analysis File** and the **Baseline File**. The focus is on identifying differences in logic, structure, security, and potential risks. Key changes, such as new, missing, or modified instructions, are highlighted, along with any suspicious alterations.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n#### Structural Changes\n- **New Instructions**: The Analysis File includes several new function calls and logic that are absent in the Baseline File.\n- **Modified Instructions**: Specific logic and function calls have been altered, potentially impacting the system's behavior.\n\n#### Logic Changes\n- **Alarm Handling**:\n  - **Analysis File**: Includes a mechanism to skip the alarm function block using an attacker-controlled bit (`M1.0`). This allows bypassing alarm notifications, which is a significant security risk.\n  - **Baseline File**: Does not contain this bypass mechanism, indicating a more secure handling of alarms.\n\n- **Alarm Acknowledgment and Reset**:\n  - **Analysis File**: Contains logic to force alarm acknowledgment and reset using `DB99.DBX 0.1` and `DB99.DBX 0.2`. This could be used to suppress alarms without operator intervention.\n  - **Baseline File**: Lacks this forced acknowledgment and reset logic, suggesting a manual process for alarm handling.\n\n- **Continuous Alarm Triggering**:\n  - **Analysis File**: Continuously triggers alarms by repeatedly calling `FB 103, DB122`. This could lead to alarm flooding, masking genuine alerts.\n  - **Baseline File**: Does not include this continuous triggering, indicating a more controlled alarm management process.\n\n#### Security Implications\n- **Bypass Mechanisms**:\n  - The ability to bypass alarms and force acknowledgment/reset poses a **critical security risk**. It allows attackers to manipulate alarm systems, potentially hiding malicious activities.\n\n- **Simulation Bypass**:\n  - The Analysis File includes logic to bypass switch mapping when simulation is enabled (`M10.0 GLOBAL_SIM_ON`). This could be exploited to alter system behavior during testing phases.\n\n#### Function Calls\n- **Additional Function Calls**:\n  - The Analysis File includes numerous additional function calls (`FC 501` to `FC 524`) for group devices, which are not present in the Baseline File. These could introduce new functionalities or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Summary of Key Risks and Recommendations\n\n#### Key Risks\n- **Alarm System Manipulation**: The ability to bypass and force reset alarms can lead to undetected system failures or malicious activities.\n- **Logic Bombs**: The use of attacker-controlled bits to alter system behavior suggests potential logic bombs.\n- **Increased Attack Surface**: Additional function calls and bypass mechanisms increase the system's complexity and potential vulnerabilities.\n\n#### Recommendations\n- **Review and Remove Bypass Logic**: Eliminate the ability to bypass alarms and force resets to ensure alarms function as intended.\n- **Conduct Security Audits**: Regularly audit PLC code for unauthorized changes and potential vulnerabilities.\n- **Implement Access Controls**: Restrict access to modify PLC code to authorized personnel only.\n- **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement robust monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activities promptly.\n\nBy addressing these risks and implementing the recommendations, the security and integrity of the PLC system can be significantly improved.",

    "result": "## Comparison of PLC Code Files\n\nThis analysis compares the provided **Analysis File** with the **Baseline File** for the Siemens PLC program, specifically focusing on the organization block OB35. The goal is to identify differences in logic, structure, security, and potential risks.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n#### Logic and Structure\n\n- **Network 2: Alarm Function Block**\n  - **Analysis File**: Contains a conditional skip for the alarm function block using a bit (`M1.0`) that appears to be attacker-controlled. This is a significant change from the baseline.\n  - **Baseline File**: Presumably does not contain this conditional skip, indicating that alarms were always processed.\n\n- **Network 3: Alarm Acknowledge and Reset**\n  - **Analysis File**: Includes forced setting of alarm acknowledge (`DB99.DBX 0.1`) and reset (`DB99.DBX 0.2`) push buttons.\n  - **Baseline File**: Likely does not include these forced settings, suggesting manual intervention was required.\n\n- **Network 5: Continuous Alarm Triggering**\n  - **Analysis File**: Repeatedly calls the alarm function block, potentially causing continuous alarm conditions.\n  - **Baseline File**: Presumably does not include continuous triggering, indicating alarms were triggered based on actual conditions.\n\n- **Network 6: Switch Mapping Bypass**\n  - **Analysis File**: Introduces a bypass for switch mapping when simulation is enabled (`M10.0`).\n  - **Baseline File**: Likely does not have this bypass, ensuring switch mappings are always processed.\n\n#### Security and Potential Risks\n\n- **Attacker-Controlled Logic**: The use of a bit (`M1.0`) to conditionally skip alarm processing is a potential security risk, as it could be manipulated to suppress critical alarms.\n- **Forced Alarm Acknowledge/Reset**: Automatically acknowledging and resetting alarms without operator intervention can lead to missed critical events.\n- **Continuous Alarm Triggering**: This could desensitize operators to alarms or overwhelm the system, leading to missed genuine alerts.\n- **Bypass of Switch Mapping**: Allowing bypass of input mapping during simulation could lead to discrepancies between simulated and actual operations, potentially hiding malicious activities.\n\n### Summary of Key Risks\n\n- **Logic Bombs**: The conditional logic to skip alarms and force alarm acknowledgments can be considered logic bombs, potentially inserted for malicious purposes.\n- **Operational Disruption**: Continuous alarm triggering and bypassing essential logic could disrupt normal operations and lead to safety incidents.\n- **Security Vulnerabilities**: The introduction of attacker-controlled logic and bypass mechanisms increases the attack surface of the PLC system.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- **Review and Validate Changes**: Conduct a thorough review of the changes made to the OB35 block, ensuring all modifications are justified and documented.\n- **Implement Access Controls**: Restrict access to critical bits like `M1.0` to prevent unauthorized manipulation.\n- **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for changes to critical logic and unauthorized bypasses.\n- **Conduct Security Audits**: Regularly audit PLC code for unauthorized changes and potential security vulnerabilities.\n- **Training and Awareness**: Ensure operators and engineers are trained to recognize and respond to unusual system behaviors and potential security incidents.\n\nBy addressing these risks and implementing the recommendations, the integrity and security of the PLC system can be significantly enhanced.",

    "result": "1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n- The code appears to implement a timer function block (FC3) with various modes of operation, such as pulse, external pulse, on-delay, retentive on-delay, and off-delay. It processes input signals and manages elapsed time, potentially for controlling time-based operations in an industrial process.\n- High-level concerns include potential misuse of the timer for unauthorized control logic, lack of comprehensive error handling, and possible hidden logic paths that could be exploited.\n\n---\n\n2. CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS\n\n- **Title**: Potential Logic Bomb via Timer Manipulation\n  - **Location**: Network 3, Line: `U #RESET #RESET`\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic resets the timer and output when the reset condition is met. This could be manipulated to disrupt normal operations by repeatedly resetting the timer.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Could lead to unexpected process interruptions or failures if exploited.\n  - **Mitigation**: Implement additional checks to ensure reset conditions are valid and expected.\n\n- **Title**: Covert Logic via Conditional Branching\n  - **Location**: Network 3, Line: `U #HOLD // ADDED ON 26/05/2011`\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The use of the HOLD condition to branch logic could be used to hide malicious actions that only execute under specific conditions.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Hidden logic paths could be exploited to perform unauthorized actions without detection.\n  - **Mitigation**: Review and document all conditional branches, ensuring they align with operational requirements.\n\n- **Title**: Unused or Redundant Logic\n  - **Location**: Network 2, Line: `NOP 0`\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The presence of a NOP (No Operation) instruction may indicate placeholder logic that could be replaced with malicious code.\n  - **Risk Level**: Low\n  - **Impact**: While currently benign, it could be used to introduce malicious logic in the future.\n  - **Mitigation**: Remove or document the purpose of NOP instructions to prevent misuse.\n\n---\n\n3. GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS\n- The code structure includes multiple networks with logical operations and conditional branches. It uses a combination of direct memory access and symbolic addressing.\n- Naming patterns are generally clear, but some elements like `temp` and `temp_1` lack descriptive names.\n- There are undocumented elements, such as the purpose of certain temporary variables and specific logic paths.\n\n---\n\n4. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY REVIEW\n- **Unstructured Memory Access**: Direct memory access using pointers (e.g., `LAR1`, `LAR2`) is prevalent, which can lead to errors if not carefully managed.\n- **Lack of Symbolic Addressing**: Some operations use absolute addressing, which reduces readability and maintainability.\n- **Copy-Paste Logic**: Repeated logic patterns suggest potential copy-paste without adaptation, increasing maintenance burden.\n- **Poor Naming Conventions**: Temporary variables like `temp`, `temp_1` should have meaningful names to improve clarity.\n- **Missing Comments**: Key logic paths lack comments, making it difficult to understand the intent and flow of the code.\n- **Engineering Anti-patterns**: Use of NOP and unstructured branching increases the risk of errors and vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n5. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n| Risk | Description | Recommendation |\n|------|-------------|----------------|\n| Logic Bomb | Timer reset logic could be exploited | Implement validation checks for reset conditions |\n| Covert Logic | Conditional branches may hide unauthorized actions | Document and review all conditional logic paths |\n| Redundant Logic | NOP instructions could be misused | Remove or document NOP instructions |\n| Unstructured Access | Direct memory access increases error risk | Use symbolic addressing where possible |\n| Poor Documentation | Lack of comments and naming clarity | Improve documentation and naming conventions |\n\n---\n\n6. NEXT STEPS\n- Isolate suspect logic for detailed review.\n- Perform a logic diff against a trusted baseline to identify unauthorized changes.\n- Audit engineering workstation access and project files for unauthorized modifications.\n- Revalidate logic signatures and timestamps to ensure integrity.\n- Review linked FCs, OBs, and conditional FB calls for consistency and security.\n- Conduct a site-wide scan for similar patterns in other blocks to identify systemic issues.\n\n---\n\n7.

    "result": "## Comparison of PLC Code Files\n\nThis analysis compares the provided **Analysis File** (FC3 - offline) with the **Baseline File** (OB35_before.txt). The focus is on identifying differences in logic, structure, security, and potential risks. Key changes, including new, missing, or modified instructions, are highlighted.\n\n### Key Differences in Logic and Structure\n\n- **Network Additions and Modifications:**\n  - **Network 1:** \n    - The logic involves loading and transferring data between pointers and addresses. No significant changes are noted compared to the baseline.\n  - **Network 2:**\n    - The use of `SFC 20 BLKMOV` for copying variables is consistent with standard practices. No changes detected.\n  - **Network 3:**\n    - **New Logic Added:** \n      - The line `U #HOLD // ADDED ON 26/05/2011` and subsequent logic involving `#HOLD` is new. This introduces a condition that can alter the flow based on the `HOLD` input.\n    - **Potential Impact:** \n      - The addition of the `HOLD` logic could affect the timing and control flow, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if not properly managed.\n\n### Security and Risk Analysis\n\n- **Dynamic Variables:**\n  - Several variables are marked as `S7_dynamic true`, indicating they can be modified at runtime. This includes `TIME0`, `RESET`, `I0`, `Q0`, and `PTIME`.\n  - **Risk:** \n    - Dynamic variables can be a vector for unauthorized changes if access controls are not properly enforced.\n\n- **Use of Pointers:**\n  - The code extensively uses pointers (e.g., `LAR1`, `LAR2`) for data manipulation.\n  - **Risk:** \n    - Incorrect pointer handling can lead to data corruption or unintended memory access, which could be exploited for malicious purposes.\n\n- **Reset Logic:**\n  - The reset logic (`U #RESET`) is crucial for maintaining system stability.\n  - **Risk:** \n    - If the reset condition is triggered erroneously, it could lead to system downtime or malfunction.\n\n### Suspicious Changes and Logic Bombs\n\n- **No Explicit Logic Bombs Detected:**\n  - The analysis did not reveal any explicit logic bombs or malicious code segments. However, the introduction of the `HOLD` logic should be reviewed for unintended consequences.\n\n### Summary of Key Risks and Recommendations\n\n- **Key Risks:**\n  - **Dynamic Variable Manipulation:** The use of dynamic variables poses a risk if not properly secured.\n  - **Pointer Mismanagement:** Extensive pointer use requires careful handling to prevent security vulnerabilities.\n  - **New Logic Introduction:** The `HOLD` logic introduces new behavior that must be thoroughly tested.\n\n- **Recommendations:**\n  - **Conduct Security Audits:** Regularly audit access controls and permissions for dynamic variables.\n  - **Implement Pointer Safety Checks:** Ensure robust error handling and validation for pointer operations.\n  - **Test New Logic Thoroughly:** Perform comprehensive testing of the `HOLD` logic to ensure it does not introduce vulnerabilities or operational issues.\n  - **Review Change Management Processes:** Ensure all code changes are documented and reviewed to prevent unauthorized modifications.\n\nThis detailed comparison highlights the importance of maintaining rigorous security practices and thorough testing in PLC environments to mitigate potential risks.",

    "result": "1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n- **Functional Intent**: The code appears to manage the control logic for a water feed pump system, specifically handling manual/auto mode selection, pump start commands, and speed ramping operations.\n- **High-level Concerns**: The presence of hardcoded values and potential lack of input validation could pose security risks. The logic structure suggests possible vulnerabilities to unauthorized overrides or manipulation.\n\n---\n\n2. CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS\n\n- **Title**: Hardcoded Mode Overrides\n  - **Location**: Network 2, DB502.DBX0.2\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic directly writes to the mode selection bits, potentially allowing unauthorized switching between manual and auto modes.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Unauthorized mode changes could lead to operational disruptions or unsafe conditions.\n  - **Mitigation**: Implement access controls and validation checks to ensure only authorized changes are made.\n\n- **Title**: Unvalidated Speed Commands\n  - **Location**: Network 5, DB502.DBD48\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: Speed commands are moved without validation, which could allow for unsafe speed settings.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Could result in equipment damage or safety hazards if incorrect speeds are set.\n  - **Mitigation**: Introduce validation logic to ensure speed commands are within safe operational limits.\n\n- **Title**: Potential Logic Bomb via Ramping Logic\n  - **Location**: Network 5, DB212.DBX196.1\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The ramping logic can be manipulated to create unexpected operational states, potentially as a logic bomb.\n  - **Risk Level**: Critical\n  - **Impact**: Could lead to sudden and unsafe changes in pump operation, risking equipment and personnel safety.\n  - **Mitigation**: Review and secure ramping logic, ensuring it cannot be triggered unexpectedly or maliciously.\n\n---\n\n3. GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS\n- **Code Structure**: The function block uses multiple networks to manage different aspects of pump control, including mode selection and speed ramping.\n- **Naming Patterns**: Some variables and blocks have clear naming conventions, but others lack descriptive names, reducing clarity.\n- **Undocumented Elements**: Several logic paths and data manipulations lack comments, making it difficult to understand their purpose.\n\n---\n\n4. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY REVIEW\n- **Unstructured Memory Access**: Direct memory writes without symbolic addressing increase the risk of errors.\n- **Lack of Symbolic Addressing**: The use of absolute addresses instead of symbolic names reduces readability and maintainability.\n- **Copy-Paste Logic**: Repeated logic patterns suggest potential for errors and inefficiencies.\n- **Poor Naming Conventions**: Inconsistent naming reduces the clarity of the logic.\n- **Missing Comments**: Key logic paths lack documentation, hindering understanding and auditing.\n- **Engineering Anti-patterns**: The use of hardcoded values and direct memory manipulation are poor practices that increase risk.\n\n---\n\n5. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n| Risk | Description | Recommendation |\n|------|-------------|----------------|\n| Mode Override | Unauthorized mode changes | Implement access controls and validation checks |\n| Unsafe Speed Commands | Potential for unsafe speed settings | Introduce validation logic for speed commands |\n| Logic Bomb | Potential for malicious ramping logic | Secure and review ramping logic thoroughly |\n\n---\n\n6. NEXT STEPS\n- **Immediate Actions**:\n  - Isolate suspect logic for detailed review.\n  - Perform a logic diff against a trusted baseline to identify unauthorized changes.\n- **Mid-term Actions**:\n  - Audit engineering workstation access and project files for unauthorized modifications.\n  - Revalidate logic signatures and timestamps to ensure integrity.\n  - Review linked FCs, OBs, and conditional FB calls for hidden threats.\n  - Conduct a site-wide scan for similar patterns in other blocks.\n\n---\n\n7.

    "result": "1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n- The code in OB35 is designed to handle cyclic interrupts, manage digital outputs to a DCS, process alarms, and map switch inputs. It also calls multiple group device function blocks.\n- High-level concerns include potential unauthorized alarm suppression, forced alarm acknowledgments, and bypassing of critical logic, which could compromise system safety and integrity.\n\n---\n\n2. CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS\n\n- **Title**: Unauthorized Alarm Suppression\n  - **Location**: Network 2, Line 2\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic uses a memory bit (M1.0) to conditionally skip the alarm function block, potentially allowing an attacker to suppress alarms.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Critical alarms may not be processed, leading to undetected faults or hazardous conditions.\n  - **Mitigation**: Implement strict access controls and monitoring on memory bits, and ensure alarms cannot be bypassed without proper authorization.\n\n- **Title**: Forced Alarm Acknowledgment and Reset\n  - **Location**: Network 3, Lines 1-4\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic forcibly sets alarm acknowledgment and reset bits, potentially clearing alarms without operator intervention.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Operators may be unaware of active alarms, leading to unaddressed issues.\n  - **Mitigation**: Remove or restrict forced set instructions and ensure alarm handling requires manual operator input.\n\n- **Title**: Simulation Bypass of Critical Logic\n  - **Location**: Network 6, Line 1\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic bypasses switch mapping when a global simulation flag is set, potentially leading to incorrect input processing.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Incorrect system behavior during simulation mode could lead to unexpected outcomes if not properly managed.\n  - **Mitigation**: Ensure simulation mode is clearly documented and controlled, with appropriate safeguards to prevent misuse.\n\n---\n\n3. GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS\n- The code structure includes multiple function calls (FCs) and a few function blocks (FBs), with a focus on alarm handling and device group management.\n- Naming patterns are somewhat consistent, but the use of generic names like \"GRP001_DVC\" lacks clarity.\n- Some elements, such as the purpose of certain memory bits, are undocumented or poorly explained.\n\n---\n\n4. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY REVIEW\n- **Unstructured Memory Access**: Use of memory bits (e.g., M1.0) without clear documentation.\n- **Lack of Symbolic Addressing**: Direct addressing is used instead of symbolic names, reducing readability.\n- **Copy-Paste Logic**: Repeated calls to similar function blocks without variation suggest potential redundancy.\n- **Poor Naming Conventions**: Generic names for function blocks and memory bits hinder understanding.\n- **Missing Comments**: Key logic paths, especially those involving conditional logic, lack sufficient comments.\n- **Engineering Anti-patterns**: Use of forced set instructions for alarms is a poor practice that can lead to safety risks.\n\n---\n\n5. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n| Risk | Description | Recommendation |\n|------|-------------|----------------|\n| Alarm Suppression | Unauthorized bypass of alarm processing | Implement access controls and audit trails for memory bits |\n| Forced Alarm Handling | Automatic acknowledgment and reset of alarms | Require manual operator intervention for alarm handling |\n| Simulation Bypass | Critical logic bypassed during simulation | Document and control simulation mode usage |\n\n---\n\n6. NEXT STEPS\n- Isolate suspect logic related to alarm handling and memory bit usage.\n- Perform a logic diff against a trusted baseline to identify unauthorized changes.\n- Audit engineering workstation access and project files for unauthorized modifications.\n- Revalidate logic signatures and timestamps to ensure integrity.\n- Review linked FCs, OBs, and conditional FB calls for consistency and security.\n- Conduct a site-wide scan for similar patterns in other blocks to ensure comprehensive security.\n\n---\n\n7.

    "result": "1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n- The code appears to be part of a cyclic interrupt routine (OB35) designed to manage digital outputs to a Distributed Control System (DCS) and map switch inputs. It also calls a series of function blocks (FCs) related to group device logic.\n- High-level concerns include potential bypassing of input mapping when simulation is enabled, which could lead to discrepancies between simulated and actual operations.\n\n---\n\n2. CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS\n\n- **Title**: Simulation Bypass Risk\n  - **Location**: Network 2\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic bypasses the switch mapping function (FC 500) when the global simulation mode is active (M 10.0). This could lead to untested or unexpected behavior in live operations if simulation is inadvertently left on.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Potential for incorrect input mapping during live operations, leading to operational errors.\n  - **Mitigation**: Implement a check to ensure simulation mode is disabled during live operations or add logging to track simulation mode status.\n\n- **Title**: Extensive Unconditional Function Calls\n  - **Location**: Networks 3 and 4\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The code unconditionally calls a large number of function blocks (FCs 501-556) without apparent conditional logic or error handling.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Increased risk of performance degradation or unintended operations if any FC contains faulty or malicious logic.\n  - **Mitigation**: Review each FC for logic integrity and implement conditional checks or error handling mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n3. GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS\n- The code structure includes a series of FC calls organized into networks. The naming pattern suggests a modular approach, but the lack of detailed comments or documentation for each FC call reduces clarity.\n- The use of a global simulation flag (M 10.0) is noted, but its implications are not fully documented.\n\n---\n\n4. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY REVIEW\n- **Unstructured Memory Access**: The use of direct memory addresses (e.g., M 10.0) without symbolic addressing can lead to maintenance challenges.\n- **Lack of Symbolic Addressing**: Recommend using symbolic names for memory markers to improve readability.\n- **Copy-Paste Logic**: The repeated structure of FC calls suggests potential for copy-paste logic, which can lead to errors.\n- **Poor Naming Conventions**: The FC names are generic and do not convey specific functionality.\n- **Missing Comments**: Key logic paths, especially around simulation bypass, lack comments explaining their purpose.\n- **Engineering Anti-patterns**: The lack of conditional logic for FC calls is an anti-pattern that increases error risk.\n\n---\n\n5. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n| Risk | Description | Recommendation |\n|------|-------------|----------------|\n| Simulation Bypass Risk | Bypassing input mapping during simulation can lead to operational errors. | Implement checks to ensure simulation mode is off during live operations. |\n| Extensive Unconditional Function Calls | Unconditional FC calls can degrade performance or cause unintended operations. | Review FC logic and add conditional checks or error handling. |\n| Lack of Symbolic Addressing | Direct memory access without symbolic names reduces readability. | Use symbolic addressing for memory markers. |\n| Poor Documentation | Lack of comments and documentation reduces code clarity. | Add detailed comments and documentation for each FC call. |\n\n---\n\n6. NEXT STEPS\n- Isolate suspect logic related to simulation bypass.\n- Perform a logic diff against a trusted baseline to identify unauthorized changes.\n- Audit engineering workstation access and project files for unauthorized modifications.\n- Revalidate logic signatures and timestamps to ensure integrity.\n- Review linked FCs, OBs, and conditional FB calls for consistency and correctness.\n- Conduct a site-wide scan for similar patterns in other blocks to ensure no widespread issues.\n\n---\n\n7.

CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS\n\n- **Title**: Unauthorized Alarm Suppression\n  - **Location**: Network 2, M1.0\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic uses a memory bit (M1.0) to conditionally skip the alarm function block call, potentially allowing an attacker to suppress alarms.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Critical alarms may be suppressed, leading to undetected faults or hazardous conditions.\n  - **Mitigation**: Implement access controls and monitoring on memory bits, and ensure alarm logic cannot be bypassed without proper authorization.\n\n- **Title**: Forced Alarm Acknowledgment and Reset\n  - **Location**: Network 3, DB99.DBX0.1 and DB99.DBX0.2\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic forcibly sets alarm acknowledgment and reset bits, potentially clearing alarms without operator intervention.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Alarms may be acknowledged and reset without addressing the underlying issue, leading to safety risks.\n  - **Mitigation**: Remove or restrict forced set operations, and ensure alarms are only acknowledged/reset through authorized procedures.\n\n- **Title**: Simulation Bypass\n  - **Location**: Network 6, M10.0\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic bypasses switch mapping when a global simulation flag is set, potentially leading to discrepancies between simulated and actual operations.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Inaccurate simulation results could lead to improper system behavior during live operations.\n  - **Mitigation**: Ensure simulation flags are tightly controlled and documented, and verify that bypass logic is necessary and safe.\n\n---\n\n3. GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS\n- The code structure includes multiple function calls to device group management and alarm handling blocks.\n- Naming patterns are somewhat consistent, but the use of generic names like \"GRP001_DVC\" lacks descriptive context.\n- Some elements, such as the purpose of certain memory bits, are undocumented or poorly explained, reducing clarity.\n\n---\n\n4. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY REVIEW\n- **Unstructured Memory Access**: Use of memory bits (e.g., M1.0) without clear documentation or access control.\n- **Lack of Symbolic Addressing**: Direct addressing (e.g., DB99.DBX0.1) reduces readability and maintainability.\n- **Copy-Paste Logic**: Repeated alarm function calls with identical parameters suggest potential for consolidation.\n- **Poor Naming Conventions**: Device group names lack descriptive context, hindering understanding.\n- **Missing Comments**: Key logic paths, such as alarm suppression, lack sufficient commentary to explain their purpose.\n- **Engineering Anti-patterns**: Use of forced set operations for alarms is a risky practice that should be avoided.\n\n---\n\n5. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n| Risk | Description | Recommendation |\n|------|-------------|----------------|\n| Alarm Suppression | Unauthorized bypass of alarm logic | Implement access controls and monitoring on memory bits |\n| Forced Alarm Reset | Alarms acknowledged/reset without resolution | Remove forced set operations and enforce proper procedures |\n| Simulation Bypass | Potential discrepancies in simulation vs. live operations | Control simulation flags and verify bypass logic necessity |\n\n---\n\n6. NEXT STEPS\n- Isolate suspect logic related to alarm suppression and forced acknowledgment.\n- Perform logic diff against a trusted baseline to identify unauthorized changes.\n- Audit engineering workstation access and project files for unauthorized modifications.\n- Revalidate logic signatures and timestamps for integrity.\n- Review linked FCs, OBs, and conditional FB calls for consistency and security.\n- Conduct a site-wide scan for similar patterns in other blocks to ensure comprehensive security.\n\n---\n\n7.

It also involves calling multiple group device function calls.\n- High-level concerns include potential unauthorized alarm suppression, forced alarm acknowledgments, and bypassing of switch mapping logic, which could lead to safety and operational risks.\n\n2. CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS\n- **Title**: Unauthorized Alarm Suppression\n  - **Location**: Network 2, Line 2\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The use of memory bit M1.0 allows an attacker to skip the alarm function block call, effectively suppressing alarms.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Critical alarms may be suppressed, leading to unmonitored hazardous conditions.\n  - **Mitigation**: Implement access controls and monitoring on memory bit M1.0 to prevent unauthorized manipulation.\n\n- **Title**: Forced Alarm Acknowledge and Reset\n  - **Location**: Network 3, Lines 1-4\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic forcibly sets the alarm acknowledge and reset bits, potentially clearing alarms without operator intervention.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Operators may not be aware of active alarms, leading to delayed response to critical events.\n  - **Mitigation**: Remove or conditionally control the forced set instructions to ensure alarms are acknowledged and reset only by authorized personnel.\n\n- **Title**: Bypassed Switch Mapping\n  - **Location**: Network 6, Lines 1-4\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The switch mapping function is bypassed when a global simulation mode is enabled, which could lead to incorrect input processing.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Incorrect or unintended switch inputs could be processed, affecting system operations.\n  - **Mitigation**: Ensure simulation mode is only enabled during testing and is properly controlled and documented.\n\n3. GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS\n- The code structure includes multiple function calls (FCs) and a single alarm function block (FB) call. There is a lack of modularity and clarity in naming conventions.\n- The use of memory bits for critical control logic is undocumented and poorly explained, increasing the risk of misuse.\n\n4. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY REVIEW\n- Issues include unstructured memory access with direct manipulation of memory bits, lack of symbolic addressing, and poor naming conventions.\n- Improvements: Use symbolic addressing for clarity, document memory bit usage, and refactor logic to enhance modularity and maintainability.\n\n5. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n| Risk | Description | Recommendation |\n|------|-------------|----------------|\n| Unauthorized Alarm Suppression | Memory bit M1.0 allows alarm suppression | Implement access controls on M1.0 |\n| Forced Alarm Acknowledge | Alarms are forcibly acknowledged and reset | Remove forced set instructions |\n| Bypassed Switch Mapping | Switch mapping bypassed in simulation mode | Control simulation mode access |\n\n6. NEXT STEPS\n- Isolate suspect logic related to alarm suppression and forced acknowledgments.\n- Perform a logic diff against a trusted baseline to identify unauthorized changes.\n- Audit engineering workstation access and project files for unauthorized modifications.\n- Revalidate logic signatures and timestamps for integrity.\n- Review linked FCs, OBs, and conditional FB calls for similar patterns.\n\n7.

    "result": "1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n- **Functional Intent**: The code appears to manage alarm handling and device group control within a Siemens PCS7 environment. It includes logic for cyclic interrupt handling, alarm acknowledgment, and device group function calls.\n- **High-Level Concerns**: The presence of an attacker-controlled bit to skip alarm function blocks and forced alarm acknowledgments are immediate security concerns. Additionally, the bypass of switch mapping during simulation poses a risk if not properly managed.\n\n---\n\n2. CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS\n\n- **Title**: Attacker-Controlled Alarm Suppression\n  - **Location**: Network 2, Line with `U M 1.0`\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic uses a memory bit (M1.0) to conditionally skip the alarm function block, potentially allowing an attacker to suppress alarms.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Critical alarms may be suppressed, leading to undetected faults or hazardous conditions.\n  - **Mitigation**: Remove or secure the memory bit control to ensure alarms cannot be bypassed without proper authorization.\n\n- **Title**: Forced Alarm Acknowledge and Reset\n  - **Location**: Network 3, Lines with `SET = DB99.DBX 0.1` and `SET = DB99.DBX 0.2`\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic forcibly sets alarm acknowledge and reset bits, potentially clearing alarms without operator intervention.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Alarms may be cleared without addressing the underlying issue, leading to safety risks.\n  - **Mitigation**: Implement checks to ensure alarms are acknowledged and reset only through authorized operator actions.\n\n- **Title**: Simulation Bypass of Switch Mapping\n  - **Location**: Network 6, Line with `UN M 10.0`\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The switch mapping function is bypassed when a global simulation flag is set, which could lead to incorrect input handling during simulation.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Incorrect simulation results could lead to improper system behavior in live environments.\n  - **Mitigation**: Ensure simulation flags are tightly controlled and reviewed regularly.\n\n---\n\n3. GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS\n- **Code Structure**: The code is structured into networks with calls to various function blocks (FCs) and function blocks (FBs). There is a clear separation of alarm handling and device group management.\n- **Naming Patterns**: Function and variable names are somewhat descriptive but could benefit from more detailed comments.\n- **Undocumented Elements**: The use of memory bits for control logic lacks documentation, which could lead to misunderstandings or misuse.\n\n---\n\n4. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY REVIEW\n- **Unstructured Memory Access**: Use of memory bits (e.g., M1.0) without clear documentation or control.\n- **Lack of Symbolic Addressing**: Direct addressing (e.g., DB99.DBX 0.1) is used instead of symbolic names, reducing readability.\n- **Copy-Paste Logic**: Repeated calls to similar function blocks without clear differentiation.\n- **Poor Naming Conventions**: Some function calls and variables lack descriptive names, making the code harder to follow.\n- **Missing Comments**: Key logic paths, especially those involving control bits, lack sufficient comments.\n- **Engineering Anti-Patterns**: Use of global simulation flags without clear control mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n5. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n| Risk | Description | Recommendation |\n|------|-------------|----------------|\n| Alarm Suppression | Alarms can be suppressed using an attacker-controlled bit. | Secure or remove the memory bit control. |\n| Forced Alarm Reset | Alarms are forcibly acknowledged and reset. | Implement authorization checks for alarm handling. |\n| Simulation Bypass | Switch mapping is bypassed during simulation. | Control and review simulation flags regularly. |\n\n---\n\n6. NEXT STEPS\n- **Immediate Actions**:\n  - Isolate suspect logic involving memory bits and forced alarm handling.\n  - Perform a logic diff against a trusted baseline to identify unauthorized changes.\n- **Mid-Term Actions**:\n  - Audit engineering workstation access and project files for unauthorized modifications.\n  - Revalidate logic signatures and timestamps to ensure integrity.\n  - Review linked FCs, OBs, and conditional FB calls for similar patterns.\n\n---\n\n7.

It also includes calls to various group device function calls.\n- High-level concerns include potential unauthorized control over alarm functions, bypassing of critical logic, and the presence of attacker-controlled bits that could manipulate system behavior.\n\n---\n\n2. CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS\n\n- **Title**: Attacker-Controlled Alarm Bypass\n  - **Location**: Network 2, Line 1\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic uses a memory bit (M1.0) to conditionally skip the alarm function block. If this bit is manipulated by an attacker, it could prevent alarms from being triggered.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Critical alarms may be suppressed, leading to unmonitored hazardous conditions.\n  - **Mitigation**: Implement access controls to prevent unauthorized changes to memory bits and ensure alarm logic cannot be bypassed.\n\n- **Title**: Forced Alarm Acknowledge and Reset\n  - **Location**: Network 3, Lines 1-4\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic forcibly sets bits to acknowledge and reset alarms, potentially without operator intervention.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Alarms may be cleared without addressing the underlying issue, leading to safety risks.\n  - **Mitigation**: Remove forced set instructions and ensure alarm handling requires operator confirmation.\n\n- **Title**: Simulation Bypass of Switch Mapping\n  - **Location**: Network 6, Line 1\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The switch mapping function is bypassed when a global simulation mode is enabled, potentially affecting real-world operations.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Incorrect switch states may be processed, leading to operational errors.\n  - **Mitigation**: Ensure simulation mode is tightly controlled and documented, with clear transition procedures between simulation and live modes.\n\n---\n\n3. GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS\n- The code structure includes multiple function calls to handle DCS outputs, alarms, and device groups.\n- Naming patterns are somewhat clear but could benefit from more descriptive comments, especially for critical logic paths.\n- There are undocumented elements, such as the purpose of specific memory bits and the detailed function of each group device call.\n\n---\n\n4. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY REVIEW\n- Issues include unstructured memory access with direct bit manipulation (e.g., M1.0) and lack of symbolic addressing.\n- The code contains repetitive logic, such as multiple calls to the same alarm function block.\n- Naming conventions are inconsistent, and key logic paths lack comments.\n- Improvements: Use symbolic addressing, enhance comments for clarity, and refactor repetitive logic into reusable functions.\n\n---\n\n5. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n| Risk | Description | Recommendation |\n|------|-------------|----------------|\n| Alarm Suppression | Alarms can be bypassed using a memory bit. | Implement strict access controls and audit trails for memory bit changes. |\n| Forced Alarm Handling | Alarms are acknowledged/reset without operator input. | Remove forced set instructions and require manual operator intervention. |\n| Simulation Bypass | Switch mapping bypassed in simulation mode. | Document and control simulation mode transitions to prevent operational errors. |\n\n---\n\n6. NEXT STEPS\n- Isolate suspect logic, particularly around alarm handling and memory bit manipulation.\n- Perform a logic diff against a trusted baseline to identify unauthorized changes.\n- Audit engineering workstation access and project files for unauthorized modifications.\n- Revalidate logic signatures and timestamps to ensure integrity.\n- Review linked FCs, OBs, and conditional FB calls for similar patterns.\n- Conduct a site-wide scan for similar bypass patterns in other blocks.\n\n---\n\n7.

    "result": "1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n- The code in OB35 appears to manage digital outputs to a DCS and handle alarm functions, with additional logic for switch input mapping and device group calls.\n- High-level concerns include potential unauthorized alarm suppression and forced alarm acknowledgments, which could mask critical system alerts and compromise safety.\n\n---\n\n2. CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS\n\n- **Title**: Unauthorized Alarm Suppression\n  - **Location**: Network 2, M1.0\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic uses a memory bit (M1.0) to conditionally skip the alarm function block call, potentially allowing an attacker to suppress alarms.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Critical alarms may be suppressed, leading to undetected faults or hazardous conditions.\n  - **Mitigation**: Implement strict access controls and monitoring on memory bits, and ensure alarm logic cannot be bypassed without authorization.\n\n- **Title**: Forced Alarm Acknowledge and Reset\n  - **Location**: Network 3, DB99.DBX0.1 and DB99.DBX0.2\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic forcibly sets alarm acknowledge and reset bits, potentially clearing alarms without operator intervention.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Alarms may be prematurely cleared, leading to a false sense of security and delayed response to actual issues.\n  - **Mitigation**: Remove or restrict forced set instructions and ensure alarm handling requires operator confirmation.\n\n- **Title**: Simulation Bypass of Switch Mapping\n  - **Location**: Network 6, M10.0\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The switch mapping function is bypassed when a global simulation flag is set, potentially altering system behavior during simulation.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: System behavior may not reflect actual conditions during simulation, leading to incorrect assumptions about system performance.\n  - **Mitigation**: Ensure simulation flags are tightly controlled and documented, and verify that bypass logic is safe and necessary.\n\n---\n\n3. GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS\n- The code structure includes multiple function calls (FCs and FBs) for handling alarms, switch mapping, and device group operations.\n- Naming patterns are generally descriptive, but some elements like memory bits lack clear documentation.\n- There are undocumented elements, such as the purpose of specific memory bits and the logic behind certain function calls.\n\n---\n\n4. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY REVIEW\n- **Unstructured Memory Access**: Use of memory bits (e.g., M1.0) without clear documentation or access control.\n- **Lack of Symbolic Addressing**: Direct memory addresses are used instead of symbolic names, reducing readability.\n- **Copy-Paste Logic**: Repeated alarm function calls with similar parameters suggest potential redundancy.\n- **Poor Naming Conventions**: Some memory bits and function calls lack descriptive names, hindering understanding.\n- **Missing Comments**: Key logic paths, such as alarm suppression and forced acknowledgments, lack explanatory comments.\n- **Engineering Anti-patterns**: Use of forced set instructions for alarms increases the risk of errors and security issues.\n\n---\n\n5. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n| Risk | Description | Recommendation |\n|------|-------------|----------------|\n| Unauthorized Alarm Suppression | Alarms can be bypassed using a memory bit. | Implement access controls and monitoring on memory bits. |\n| Forced Alarm Acknowledge | Alarms are forcibly acknowledged and reset. | Remove forced set instructions and require operator confirmation. |\n| Simulation Bypass | Switch mapping is bypassed during simulation. | Control simulation flags and verify bypass logic. |\n\n---\n\n6. NEXT STEPS\n- Isolate suspect logic related to alarm suppression and forced acknowledgments.\n- Perform a logic diff against a trusted baseline to identify unauthorized changes.\n- Audit engineering workstation access and project files for unauthorized modifications.\n- Revalidate logic signatures and timestamps to ensure integrity.\n- Review linked FCs, OBs, and conditional FB calls for similar patterns.\n- Conduct a site-wide scan for similar patterns in other blocks.\n\n---\n\n7.
