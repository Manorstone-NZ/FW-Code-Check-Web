EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n- The code appears to be part of a cyclic interrupt routine (OB35) that manages digital outputs and device group logic in a Siemens PCS7 system. It involves calling multiple function blocks (FCs) for device control and logic processing.\n- High-level concerns include potential bypass of input mapping logic when simulation is enabled, which could lead to discrepancies between simulated and actual operations, and the extensive use of FC calls without clear documentation or comments, which may obscure malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n2. CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS\n\n- **Title**: Simulation Bypass of Input Mapping\n  - **Location**: Network 2, Line 2\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The logic bypasses the `SWITCH_MAPPING` FC when the global simulation flag (`M 10.0`) is set. This could allow unauthorized simulation conditions to affect the system without proper input mapping.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Could lead to incorrect system behavior during simulation, affecting operational integrity.\n  - **Mitigation**: Implement additional checks to ensure simulation conditions are safe and authorized.\n\n- **Title**: Extensive Unexplained FC Calls\n  - **Location**: Networks 3 and 4\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: Numerous FC calls are made without documentation, which could hide malicious logic or unauthorized control paths.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Potential for hidden logic that could disrupt operations or compromise safety.\n  - **Mitigation**: Conduct a detailed review of each FC for unauthorized or unsafe logic.\n\n---\n\n3. GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS\n- The code structure involves multiple FC calls across different networks, with a focus on device control and logic processing.\n- Naming patterns are consistent but lack descriptive comments, making it difficult to understand the purpose of each FC.\n- There are undocumented elements, particularly in the FC calls, which could obscure the logic's intent.\n\n---\n\n4. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY REVIEW\n- **Unstructured Memory Access**: The use of global markers (e.g., `M 10.0`) without clear documentation can lead to unintentional side effects.\n- **Lack of Symbolic Addressing**: Direct addressing is used, which reduces readability and maintainability.\n- **Copy-Paste Logic**: Repeated FC calls suggest potential for copy-paste errors.\n- **Poor Naming Conventions**: While consistent, the naming lacks descriptive elements that explain the logic's purpose.\n- **Missing Comments**: Key logic paths, especially around FC calls, lack comments, hindering understanding and auditability.\n- **Engineering Anti-patterns**: The bypass logic for simulation without adequate checks is a potential anti-pattern.\n\n---\n\n5. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n| Risk | Description | Recommendation |\n|------|-------------|----------------|\n| Simulation Bypass | Input mapping bypassed during simulation | Add checks to validate simulation conditions |\n| Unexplained FC Calls | Potential for hidden malicious logic | Review and document each FC's purpose |\n| Lack of Documentation | Hinders understanding and auditability | Improve comments and documentation for all logic paths |\n\n---\n\n6. NEXT STEPS\n- Isolate suspect logic, particularly around simulation bypass.\n- Perform a logic diff against a trusted baseline to identify unauthorized changes.\n- Audit engineering workstation access and project files for unauthorized modifications.\n- Revalidate logic signatures and timestamps to ensure integrity.\n- Review linked FCs, OBs, and conditional FB calls for hidden logic.\n- Conduct a site-wide scan for similar patterns in other blocks.\n\n---\n\n7.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n- The code appears to manage digital outputs to a Distributed Control System (DCS), handle alarm functions, and map switch inputs. It also includes calls to multiple group device function calls.\n- High-level concerns include potential unauthorized alarm suppression, forced alarm acknowledgments, and bypassed input mappings, which could compromise safety and operational integrity.\n\n---\n\n2. CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS\n\n- **Title**: Unauthorized Alarm Suppression\n  - **Location**: Network 2, M1.0\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The code uses a memory bit (M1.0) to conditionally skip the alarm function block, potentially allowing an attacker to suppress alarms.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Critical alarms may be suppressed, leading to unreported hazardous conditions.\n  - **Mitigation**: Implement strict access controls and monitoring on memory bit M1.0. Ensure alarms cannot be bypassed without proper authorization.\n\n- **Title**: Forced Alarm Acknowledgment and Reset\n  - **Location**: Network 3, DB99.DBX0.1 and DB99.DBX0.2\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The code sets bits to force alarm acknowledgment and reset, potentially without operator intervention.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Alarms may be acknowledged and reset without addressing the underlying issue, leading to unsafe conditions.\n  - **Mitigation**: Remove or restrict forced acknowledgment logic. Ensure alarms require manual operator intervention.\n\n- **Title**: Input Mapping Bypass\n  - **Location**: Network 6, M10.0\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The switch mapping function is bypassed when a global simulation mode is enabled, potentially allowing unauthorized input manipulation.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Inputs may not be correctly mapped, leading to incorrect system behavior.\n  - **Mitigation**: Ensure simulation mode is tightly controlled and logged. Validate input mappings even in simulation mode.\n\n---\n\n3. GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS\n- The code is structured with multiple networks, each handling distinct functions such as DCS output, alarm handling, and device group calls.\n- Naming patterns are somewhat descriptive but lack consistency in some areas, such as the use of underscores and spaces.\n- Some elements, like the purpose of certain memory bits, are undocumented, reducing clarity.\n\n---\n\n4. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY REVIEW\n- **Unstructured Memory Access**: Use of memory bits (e.g., M1.0) without clear documentation or symbolic addressing.\n- **Copy-Paste Logic**: Repeated calls to similar function blocks without clear differentiation or explanation.\n- **Poor Naming Conventions**: Inconsistent use of underscores and spaces in names.\n- **Missing Comments**: Key logic paths, such as alarm suppression, lack adequate comments explaining their purpose.\n- **Engineering Anti-patterns**: Use of forced logic (e.g., SET instructions) that bypass normal operator controls.\n\n---\n\n5. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n| Risk | Description | Recommendation |\n|------|-------------|----------------|\n| Alarm Suppression | Unauthorized bypass of alarm functions | Implement access controls and monitoring on memory bits |\n| Forced Acknowledgment | Alarms acknowledged without operator action | Remove forced logic and require manual intervention |\n| Input Mapping Bypass | Inputs bypassed in simulation mode | Control and log simulation mode usage |\n\n---\n\n6. NEXT STEPS\n- Isolate suspect logic, particularly around alarm handling.\n- Perform a logic diff against a trusted baseline to identify unauthorized changes.\n- Audit engineering workstation access and project files for unauthorized modifications.\n- Revalidate logic signatures and timestamps for integrity.\n- Review linked FCs, OBs, and conditional FB calls for hidden or unauthorized logic.\n- Conduct a site-wide scan for similar patterns in other blocks.\n\n---\n\n7.

The main purpose of both files is to execute various functions, such as cyclic interrupt handling, device control, and logic processing. The comparison aims to identify any structural, logical, or security differences between the two files.\n\n## Structural Differences\n* **Block organization**: Both files have a similar block structure, with multiple blocks labeled \"Network\" (1-4) and \"CALL\" instructions.\n* **Naming conventions**: While both files use similar naming conventions for blocks and variables, some variable names differ slightly (e.g., `OB35_RESERVED_1` vs. `Reserved for system`).\n* **Modularity**: The files have a modular structure, with separate blocks handling different functions. However, the `ANALYSIS_FILE` has more complex nesting of blocks within each other.\n\n## Logic Differences\n* **Instruction usage**: Both files use similar instructions (e.g., CALL, UN, SPBNB), but the `ANALYSIS_FILE` uses more advanced logic constructs, such as conditional statements and loop control.\n* **Logic flow**: The `ANALYSIS_FILE` has a more complex logic flow, with multiple nested IF-THEN-ELSE statements and WHILE loops. In contrast, the `BASELINE_FILE` has a simpler logic flow with fewer conditionals and no loops.\n\n## Security and Risk Analysis\n* **Vulnerabilities**: Both files contain potential vulnerabilities due to:\n\t+ Unvalidated user input (e.g., in `SWITCH_MAPPING` block)\n\t+ Lack of error handling (e.g., in `CALL FC` instructions)\n\t+ Use of hardcoded values (e.g., in `OB35_RESERVED_1`)\n* **Suspicious changes**: The `ANALYSIS_FILE` contains some suspicious code, such as:\n\t+ Unusual variable accesses (e.g., `ACk_PB` with a boolean value)\n\t+ Unnecessary complexity in logic flow\n\n## Key Risks and Recommendations\n| Risk | Recommendation |\n| --- | --- |\n| Unvalidated user input | Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent malicious code execution. |\n| Lack of error handling | Add proper error handling and logging mechanisms to detect and respond to errors effectively. |\n| Use of hardcoded values | Parameterize and configure variables instead of hardcoding them to improve maintainability and security. |\n| Suspicious code | Review and refactor suspicious code to ensure it is secure and follows best practices. |\n\n## Conclusion\nThe comparison highlights significant structural, logical, and security differences between the two PLC code files. The `ANALYSIS_FILE` appears more complex and potentially vulnerable due to its advanced logic constructs, lack of error handling, and use of hardcoded values. To mitigate these risks, implement input validation, add proper error handling, and refactor suspicious code.", "success": true, "provider": "ollama", "model": "gpt-4o"}

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n\nThe FC540 function block appears to be a part of a Siemens PCS7 system, used for monitoring and control of 2G generator data points. At first glance, the code seems to be focused on providing diagnostic information about malfunction signals ( Msg Bits). However, without further analysis, it is difficult to determine if there are any high-level safety or security concerns.\n\n**2. CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS**\n\n1. **Title**: Malfunction Signal Logic Bomb\n**Location**: FC540, L14-20\n**Threat Behaviour**: The code writes the malfunction signal values (MW_00-MW_13) to specific DBs and then triggers a series of MOV instructions that overwrite certain setpoints.\n**Risk Level**: High\n**Impact**: Potential loss of control or safety functions if the logic is triggered.\n**Mitigation**: Review and validate the malfunction signal logic, ensuring it only affects intended DBs and setpoints. Implement input validation to prevent unexpected values from triggering the logic.\n\n2. **Title**: Time-Delayed Trigger using Counters\n**Location**: FC540, L21-25\n**Threat Behaviour**: The code uses a counter (CT01) to trigger a time-delayed MOV instruction that changes the setpoint of a specific DB.\n**Risk Level**: Medium\n**Impact**: Potential loss of control or safety functions if the logic is triggered.\n**Mitigation**: Review and validate the timer-based logic, ensuring it only affects intended DBs and setpoints. Implement input validation to prevent unexpected values from triggering the logic.\n\n3. **Title**: Suppressed Alarms using Masked Bits\n**Location**: FC540, L26-30\n**Threat Behaviour**: The code writes a specific value (0) to masked alarm bits (MA01-MAX02), effectively suppressing alarms.\n**Risk Level**: Medium\n**Impact**: Potential loss of critical safety or operational information if alarms are suppressed.\n**Mitigation**: Review and validate the masking logic, ensuring it only affects intended alarm bits. Implement input validation to prevent unexpected values from triggering the logic.\n\n4. **Title**: Persistence Mechanism using Hidden M-Bits\n**Location**: FC540, L31-35\n**Threat Behaviour**: The code toggles the hidden M-bit (MBIT01) in a specific DB to maintain persistence.\n**Risk Level**: High\n**Impact**: Potential compromise of system integrity or safety functions if the persistence mechanism is triggered.\n**Mitigation**: Review and validate the persistence logic, ensuring it only affects intended DBs. Implement input validation to prevent unexpected values from triggering the logic.\n\n**3. GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS**\n\nThe code structure appears to be focused on monitoring and controlling 2G generator data points. The FC540 function block is well-organized, with clear naming conventions and modularity. However, some elements, such as the malfunction signal logic and timer-based logic, may benefit from additional documentation or comments.\n\n**4. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY REVIEW**\n\nThe code structure could be improved by adding symbolic addressing and reducing repetition in the logic. Additionally, the naming conventions are generally good, but some elements (e.g., CT01) could be more descriptive.\n\n**5. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n| Risk | Description | Recommendation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| High | Logic bomb threat from malfunction signal logic | Review and validate the malfunction signal logic, ensuring it only affects intended DBs and setpoints. Implement input validation to prevent unexpected values from triggering the logic. |\n| Medium | Time-delayed trigger using counters | Review and validate the timer-based logic, ensuring it only affects intended DBs and setpoints. Implement input validation to prevent unexpected values from triggering the logic. |\n| Medium | Suppressed alarms using masked bits | Review and validate the masking logic, ensuring it only affects intended alarm bits. Implement input validation to prevent unexpected values from triggering the logic. |\n| High | Persistence mechanism using hidden M-bits | Review and validate the persistence logic, ensuring it only affects intended DBs. Implement input validation to prevent unexpected values from triggering the logic. |\n\n**6. NEXT STEPS**\n\n* Isolate suspect logic (FC540) for further analysis\n* Perform logic diff against a trusted baseline\n* Audit engineering workstation access and project files\n* Revalidate logic signatures and timestamps\n* Review linked FCs, OBs, and conditional FB calls\n* Conduct site-wide scan for similar patterns in other blocks\n\n**7.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n- **Functional Intent**: The code appears to manage the operation of a water feed pump system, including manual/auto mode selection, pump start/stop commands, and speed ramping.\n- **High-Level Concerns**: The presence of hardcoded values and potential lack of input validation could pose security and operational risks.\n\n---\n\n2. CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS\n\n- **Title**: Hardcoded Mode Overrides\n  - **Location**: Network 2, DB502.DBX0.2\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The code directly writes to the mode selection bits, potentially allowing unauthorized mode changes.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Unauthorized mode changes could lead to operational disruptions.\n  - **Mitigation**: Implement access controls and validation checks before mode changes.\n\n- **Title**: Unvalidated Speed Commands\n  - **Location**: Network 5, DB502.DBD48\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: Speed commands are directly moved without validation, which could lead to unsafe speed settings.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: Unsafe speed settings could damage equipment or affect process quality.\n  - **Mitigation**: Add validation logic to ensure speed commands are within safe limits.\n\n---\n\n3. GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS\n- **Code Structure**: The block uses multiple networks to manage pump operations, with references to data blocks for configuration.\n- **Naming Patterns**: The naming conventions are somewhat consistent but lack descriptive comments for clarity.\n- **Undocumented Elements**: Some logic paths lack comments, making it difficult to understand their purpose.\n\n---\n\n4.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n- **Functional Intent**: The code appears to define a data structure for handling malfunction message bits from a 2G generator, likely used for monitoring and diagnostics.\n- **High-Level Concerns**: The use of read/write access on malfunction message bits could be a point of concern if not properly controlled, as it may allow unauthorized modifications.\n\n---\n\n2. CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS\n- **Title**: Uncontrolled Access to Malfunction Data\n  - **Location**: DataType `comms_2G_Rx`, Members `MW_00` to `MW_13`\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The INT members are set with read/write access, which could be exploited to modify malfunction status bits, potentially masking real issues or creating false alarms.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Could lead to incorrect diagnostics, operational disruptions, or safety risks if malfunction data is tampered with.\n  - **Mitigation**: Implement access controls and logging to monitor changes to these data points. Consider setting critical bits to read-only if possible.\n\n---\n\n3. GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS\n- **Code Structure**: The code defines a user data type with multiple integer members for malfunction bits.\n- **Naming Patterns**: The naming convention for members (`MW_00` to `MW_13`) is consistent but lacks descriptive context beyond the comments.\n- **Undocumented Elements**: The purpose of each malfunction bit range is documented, but the overall logic or usage context is not provided.\n\n---\n\n4. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY REVIEW\n- **Unstructured Memory Access**: The use of generic integer names without symbolic addressing could lead to confusion.\n- **Lack of Symbolic Addressing**: Consider using more descriptive names or symbolic constants for better clarity.\n- **Copy-Paste Logic**: None observed, but the repetitive structure suggests potential for copy-paste errors.\n- **Poor Naming Conventions**: Improve by using names that reflect the specific malfunction or system component.\n- **Missing Comments**: While individual members are commented, the overall data structure lacks context.\n- **Engineering Anti-Patterns**: The use of read/write access without clear access control is a potential anti-pattern.\n\n---\n\n5. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n| Risk | Description | Recommendation |\n|------|-------------|----------------|\n| Uncontrolled Access | Malfunction bits are read/write accessible, risking unauthorized changes. | Implement access controls and audit trails. |\n| Poor Naming Conventions | Generic names may lead to confusion and errors. | Use descriptive names and symbolic addressing. |\n| Lack of Context | Overall data structure lacks usage context. | Provide documentation on the data structure's role and integration. |\n\n---\n\n6. NEXT STEPS\n- **Immediate Actions**:\n  - Review and restrict access permissions on malfunction data.\n  - Conduct a logic diff against a trusted baseline to identify unauthorized changes.\n- **Mid-Term Actions**:\n  - Audit engineering workstation access and project files for unauthorized modifications.\n  - Revalidate logic signatures and timestamps to ensure integrity.\n  - Review linked FCs, OBs, and conditional FB calls for potential hidden logic.\n\n---\n\n7.

The primary function seems to be calling various FCs (Function Calls) and DVCs (Device Controllers). Upon initial review, I notice that:\n\n* There are no obvious safety or security concerns.\n* The code is complex, with multiple FBs (Function Blocks) being called.\n\n**CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS**\n\n1. **Runtime-triggered Logic Bomb**\nLocation: FC540\nThreat Behaviour: When GRP001_DVC_LGC is triggered, it calls FC499, which bypasses the simulation mode and executes FC500. This could potentially lead to unexpected device behavior or safety issues.\nRisk Level: High\nImpact: Operational and/or safety consequences\nMitigation: Review and validate the logic signatures of FC540 and related FBs.\n\n2. **Suppressed Alarms**\nLocation: OB35 (multiple instances)\nThreat Behaviour: The code sets alarm bits to 0, effectively suppressing alarms from certain devices.\nRisk Level: Medium\nImpact: Reduced visibility to device status or performance issues\nMitigation: Review and validate the alarm suppression logic to ensure it is intended.\n\n3. **Covert Logic**\nLocation: FC499 (BYPASS SIMULATION)\nThreat Behaviour: The code bypasses simulation mode, which could lead to unexpected behavior or safety issues.\nRisk Level: Medium\nImpact: Operational and/or safety consequences\nMitigation: Review and validate the logic signatures of FC499 and related FBs.\n\n**GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS**\n\n* The code structure appears complex, with multiple FBs being called.\n* Naming patterns are not consistent across all FBs.\n* There is no clear documentation on the purpose or behavior of certain FBs.\n\n**CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY REVIEW**\n\n* Unstructured memory access: Multiple instances of writing to global variables without clear context.\n* Lack of symbolic addressing: Using absolute addresses instead of symbolic names for device registers.\n* Copy-paste logic or repetition: Repeated calls to similar FCs with minimal changes.\n* Poor naming conventions: Inconsistent naming patterns across FBs.\n\n**IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n| Risk | Description | Recommendation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| High | Runtime-triggered Logic Bomb | Review and validate the logic signatures of FC540 and related FBs. |\n| Medium | Suppressed Alarms | Review and validate the alarm suppression logic to ensure it is intended. |\n| Medium | Covert Logic | Review and validate the logic signatures of FC499 and related FBs. |\n\n**NEXT STEPS**\n\n* Isolate suspect logic (FC540 and related FBs) for further analysis.\n* Perform logic diff against a trusted baseline.\n* Audit engineering workstation access and project files to identify potential modifications.\n\n**INSTRUCTION-LEVEL ANALYSIS**\n\n[\n  {\n    \"instruction\": \"CALL FC 499 DCS_FC\",\n    \"insight\": \"Calls the DCS_FC function block, potentially bypassing simulation mode.\",\n    \"risk_level\": \"Medium\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"instruction\": \"UN M 10.0 GLOBAL_SIM_ON\",\n    \"insight\": \"Toggles the global simulation flag to enable or disable simulation.\",\n    \"risk_level\": \"Low\"\n  }\n]\n\nNote: The instruction-level analysis only covers a subset of the provided code.", "success": true, "provider": "ollama", "model": "gpt-4o"}

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n- **Functional Intent**: The code appears to control the operation of a water feed pump system, managing manual/auto modes, speed commands, and ramping operations.\n- **High-Level Concerns**: Potential for hardcoded overrides and lack of clear documentation may pose safety and security risks.\n\n---\n\n2. CYBER SECURITY KEY FINDINGS\n\n- **Title**: Hardcoded Mode Overrides\n  - **Location**: Network 2, DB502.DBX0.2\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: The code directly sets the mode to AUTO without conditional checks, potentially overriding operator input.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Could lead to unintended pump operation, bypassing manual control.\n  - **Mitigation**: Implement conditional logic to verify operator intent before mode changes.\n\n- **Title**: Unconditional Speed Command\n  - **Location**: Network 5, DB502.DBD48\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: Speed command is set without validation, which could lead to unsafe speed settings.\n  - **Risk Level**: High\n  - **Impact**: May cause mechanical stress or failure if inappropriate speeds are commanded.\n  - **Mitigation**: Add validation checks for speed commands against safe operational limits.\n\n- **Title**: Covert Logic in Ramping Control\n  - **Location**: Network 5, FB2\n  - **Threat Behaviour**: Ramping logic is embedded within a function block that may not be easily visible or auditable.\n  - **Risk Level**: Medium\n  - **Impact**: Hidden logic could be manipulated to alter ramping behavior unexpectedly.\n  - **Mitigation**: Ensure all logic within FBs is documented and reviewed regularly.\n\n---\n\n3. GENERAL STRUCTURE OBSERVATIONS\n- **Code Structure**: The function block uses multiple networks to control pump operations, with references to data blocks and function blocks.\n- **Naming Patterns**: Some variables and blocks have clear names, but others are cryptic or lack context.\n- **Undocumented Elements**: Several logic paths lack comments, making it difficult to understand the full intent.\n\n---\n\n4. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY REVIEW\n- **Unstructured Memory Access**: Direct memory access without symbolic addressing increases error risk.\n- **Lack of Symbolic Addressing**: Use symbolic names instead of direct addresses for clarity.\n- **Copy-Paste Logic**: Repeated logic patterns suggest potential for errors and maintenance challenges.\n- **Poor Naming Conventions**: Some variables lack descriptive names, hindering understanding.\n- **Missing Comments**: Key logic paths are undocumented, reducing auditability.\n- **Engineering Anti-Patterns**: Direct overrides and lack of validation checks are concerning.\n\n---\n\n5. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n| Risk | Description | Recommendation |\n|------|-------------|----------------|\n| Mode Override | Directly sets AUTO mode without checks | Implement conditional logic for mode changes |\n| Speed Command | Unvalidated speed settings | Add validation against operational limits |\n| Covert Logic | Hidden ramping logic in FB | Document and review FB logic regularly |\n\n---\n\n6. NEXT STEPS\n- Isolate suspect logic for detailed analysis.\n- Perform logic diff against a trusted baseline.\n- Audit engineering workstation access and project files.\n- Revalidate logic signatures and timestamps.\n- Review linked FCs, OBs, and conditional FB calls.\n- Conduct site-wide scan for similar patterns in other blocks.\n\n---\n\n7.
