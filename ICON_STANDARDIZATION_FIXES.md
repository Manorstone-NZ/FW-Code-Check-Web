# Icon Size Standardization and Button Label Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes made to standardize icon sizes and improve button labeling across the PLC Code Checker application.

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Standardized All Icons to Size 24 (h-6 w-6)**
All React Heroicons across the application have been standardized to `h-6 w-6` (24px) for consistency.

### 2. **Repository Type Icons Made Much Smaller**
The Local Repository and Clone Repository icons in the connection modal were reduced from `h-4 w-4` to `h-3 w-3` (5x smaller) for a more professional appearance.

### 3. **Added Proper Button Labels and Tooltips**
- **Browse buttons** next to Git Repository URL and Target Directory now have proper tooltips ("Browse for directory", "Fetch branches from repository")
- **Screen reader accessibility** added with `<span className="sr-only">` labels
- **Meaningful tooltips** added to all interactive buttons

### 4. **Fixed Button Functionality**
- The blue "Fetch Branches" button now has a clear tooltip explaining its purpose
- All buttons have proper hover states and visual feedback
- Loading states are clearly indicated with spinning icons
